### a known bug (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/subversion/+bug/1959717) causes svn checkout to hang on docker containers ###
## these steps are to circumvent this bug via bash commands; if on windows, use wsl/cygwin and navigate to this directory and implement the following steps ##
# this script guides you in downloading the delft fm source code and making it available for the docker container during build #

# install subversion
sudo apt-get -y install subversion

# pull the delft3dfm svn repositry - replace the username and password placeholders with your oss.deltares.nl credentials 
svn checkout https://svn.oss.deltares.nl/repos/delft3d/tags/delft3dfm/68819/ delft3dfm_68819 --username <username> --password <password>

# zip the repositry for faster and reliable copying into docker-container filesystem and place it in the docker-mounted directory
tar -czvf delft3dfm_68819.tar.gz delft3dfm_68819
mkdir delft3dfm_source
mv delft3dfm_68819.tar.gz delft3dfm_source/
# remove the downloaded repositry from host if desired
rm -rf delft3dfm_68819

# create a scratch dir that is mapped to /home/scratch in the docker container to facilitate model runs; note: use the mapped dir only to copy files between host and the docker-container. run the model in native (non-mapped) filesystem for best performance
mkdir scratch
