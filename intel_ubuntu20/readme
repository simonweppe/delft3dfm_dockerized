1. follow the steps in ./preprocessing
2. build the docker container by navigating into the root proj dir (./) via the command "docker build --network=host -t delft3dfm ."
   note: you may replace delft3dfm with any other name desired for the docker image, but make sure to use the new name in subsequent steps
3. run the docker container with the compiled delft3dfm program (located in /opt/delft3dfm inside the container) via the command "docker run -it --rm -v %cd%/scratch:/home/"
   note: above command is for running the container via MS-CMD; for MS-PS replace %cd% with ${PWD}; and for GNU-LINUX replace %cd% with $(pwd)
   the flag --rm removes the container and its not mapped contents (not in ./scratch). either copy all desired files to this location or remove the flag before running it.
